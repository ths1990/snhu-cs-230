  <li>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?  </li>

The client, the Gaming Room, wanted me to design a game environment for their Android-only game Draw It or Lose It. They wanted the game to support one or more unique teams with multiple players. Each game would be it's own unique instance. They also wanted the game to compatible across all platforms.  

  <li>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?  </li>

I believe I did well with identifying the requirements and constraints of the software.  

  <li>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</li>
  
  Working through the design document to truly understand the requirements and constraints was helpful when developing the code. I could use each requirement as a test case to know what end goal I was working towards.  

  <li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  </li>

I would revise my recommendations section a bit more. I think I could have done a little more work in providing supporting details for my recommendations.  

  <li>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  </li>

I viewed each user need as a task that needed to be cared for - whether it was a feature or function to be implemented in the code or something to be called out in the design document. The user needs are important, because that's who the software is being designed for. If you aren't caring for the user needs in your software design, you aren't going to build a product that they would want.  

  <li>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  </li>
  
  First, I took a high level approach - taking the time to outline each requirement without thinking too much about how those requirements would be met. Next, I looked at each requirement one by one to understand exactly what is being asked and how they all fit together and creating relationship diagrams and flowcharts. I think it's a good idea to look at each requirement as it's own check list item to care for.
